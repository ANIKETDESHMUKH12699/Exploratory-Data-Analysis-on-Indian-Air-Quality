Analyze air quality data across major Indian cities to identify pollution trends, peak pollution periods, and potential correlations between pollutants and environmental factors.
This project focuses on analyzing air quality data from various cities in India to understand pollution trends, identify major pollutants, assess seasonal variations, and evaluate the effectiveness of environmental policies. The insights generated help stakeholders, including policymakers and citizens, make informed decisions regarding air pollution control.

Objectives:
To analyze the concentration of key air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3) across different Indian cities.

To observe the temporal (daily, monthly, yearly) and seasonal patterns in air pollution.

To identify the most and least polluted regions over time.

To investigate the possible causes of pollution spikes (e.g., festivals, crop burning, traffic).

To provide actionable insights and recommendations for reducing pollution levels.

Tools & Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-learn (for modeling, if used)

Data Visualization: Power BI / Tableau / Python Visualization Libraries

Data Sources: Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Open Government Data (OGD) Platform India, Kaggle

Key Steps in the Project:
1. Data Collection:
Gathered air quality data from official government websites and repositories.

Collected data for multiple Indian cities covering several years.

2. Data Cleaning:
Handled missing values and inconsistent formats.

Converted timestamps to standard formats for time-series analysis.

Removed outliers to ensure clean and reliable analysis.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyzed the distribution of pollutants.

Visualized pollution trends across cities and over time.

Identified the top polluted and clean cities in different months/seasons.

Compared pollutant levels with permissible limits.

4. Time Series and Seasonal Analysis:
Studied year-on-year and seasonal variations.

Observed pollution patterns before and after major events (e.g., lockdowns, Diwali).

5. Correlation & Cause Analysis:
Analyzed relationships between pollutants and external factors like temperature, humidity, traffic, and crop burning.

Identified potential sources of pollution.

6. Predictive Modeling (Optional):
Built models (like linear regression or time series models) to forecast pollutant levels.

Assessed model accuracy using MAE/RMSE metrics.

Findings & Insights:
PM2.5 and PM10 levels were found to be significantly above permissible limits in metro cities like Delhi, Kanpur, and Lucknow.

Winter months (especially Novemberâ€“January) saw sharp spikes in pollution due to stubble burning and low wind speeds.

Lockdowns (like during COVID-19) led to drastic improvements in air quality, highlighting the impact of reduced vehicular and industrial activity.

Cities in southern and northeastern India generally showed better air quality.

Recommendations:
Promote public transportation and clean energy sources.

Regulate and monitor construction and industrial emissions.

Implement strict policies around stubble burning with incentives for alternatives.

Encourage citizen participation in reducing pollution.

Conclusion:
This project demonstrated the power of data analytics in identifying and understanding environmental issues like air pollution. By turning raw data into meaningful insights, it provides a foundation for targeted and effective pollution control strategies.
